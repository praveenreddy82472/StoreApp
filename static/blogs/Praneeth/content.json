        "content": "Global agriculture has reached a crossroad. Although our current food system has boosted agricultural productivity over the past decades it has also had a detrimental effect on the environment and society. Soil degradation, biodiversity loss, water pollution, climate change, ocean dead zones are just a few of the challenges that we are confronted with.  To combat these and other major issues in 2015 the global community came together and launched the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; a plan of action based on 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). More and more these SDG\u2019s are determining the sustainable agenda of the planet.  Food production and consumption have a massive direct positive or negative impact on these goals.\r\n\r\nSince organic farmers all around the world refrain from using harmful agro-chemicals and work as much as possible in harmony with nature, it is clear that these heroes can be seen as part of the solution.\r\n\r\nAs this report proves, if the global community is serious about achieving the SDG\u2019s by 2030 it is essential that we switch to more sustainable farming practices like organic.",
